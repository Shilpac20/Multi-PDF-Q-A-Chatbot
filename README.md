# Multi-PDF-Q-A-Chatbot

### Description
* Developed a PDF-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot using LangChain, allowing users to query multiple documents interactively via a Streamlit UI.
* Implemented semantic search with intfloat/e5-small-v2 sentence embeddings and ChromaDB for efficient vector storage and retrieval.
* Integrated quantized open-source LLM like TinyLlama for contextual answer generation for lightweight inference on GPUs.
